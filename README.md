# Austin-Housing-data-and-activities-web-scrapping-using-python

I have worked with real estate data of the Austin metropolitan area of the state of Texas, USA. I have focused on data from 2015 for getting housing activities in Austin from the website of the Texas Real Estate Research Center, which is a research center operated at Texas A&M University. This research center has data for each county in the USA. I have specifically filtered out data for “Housing Activity for Austin County”. I have specifically filtered out data for “Housing Activity for Austin County”. From here, I scrapped the monthly housing data. 

The data Texas Real Estate Research Center website was from January 2011. But surprisingly, for some variables, there were no data before January 2015. I had to sort the data for that purpose. After scrapping the whole data table, I omitted the rows from January 2011 to December 2014 using python coding. Otherwise, it would be tedious to do the analyses. For the Price Index dataset, I reduced my dataset and using data from January 2015 to September 2022. .
